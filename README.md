# SPRO4-EM

The fourth semester project for the embedded systems profile.

## Description

The idea for the project is an equalizer that can manipulate sound by filtering and amplifying frequencies by either FFT _(fast Fourier transform)_ or by use of digital filters.

## Requirements

Obligatory features:

* stereo audio in
* stereo audio out
* 16bit sampling resolution
* 48kHz sampling frequency
* digital filters
* three encoders to control low, mid and high frequencies

Optional features:

* FFT filters
* cascaded filters
* should use on-board ADAU1761
* 24bit sampling resolution
* 96kHz sampling frequency
* 8bit distortion
* display via HDMI or VGA
* more buttons for better UX _(user experience)_
